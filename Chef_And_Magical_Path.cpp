// Since the ending cell must be adjacent to the starting cell, the found path can be immediately extended one more step, into a cycle which passes through all the cells of the maze. Such a cycle is called a Hamiltonian cycle. Note that in this case it doesnâ€™t matter which is the starting cell.

// An NxM maze has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if:

// min{N,M}=1 and max{N,M}=2, OR
// min{N,M}>=2 and at least one of N and M is even.
